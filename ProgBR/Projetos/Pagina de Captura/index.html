                <h3>Raze explodes out of Brazil with her big personality and big guns</h3>

                Tayane Alves is an engineer coming from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with a strong enthusiasm for 
                explosives and paint - usually combined. After force Kingdom Corporation's  to abandon her 
                region, she entered to the VALORANT Protocol as its twelfth agent, "Raze", Alves now sows her 
                chaos against bigger threats to Earth. However, as the paint fades from Salvador's walls, 
                Raze cannot afford to leave her home completely behind.
